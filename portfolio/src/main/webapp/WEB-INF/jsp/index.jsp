        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Carlos, and I am currently a rising junior Computer Science
            student at Tennessee Tech University. When not breaking things code
            wise, I am doing something like reading or listening to music.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy pondering the meaning of life. Specifically, considering
            why it is the number 42. Refer to
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)#The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">
                this Wikipedia article</a>, which explains it.</p>
        <p>I normally do not force Windows to crash on a daily basis, but here
            is a screenshot captured by VMware Workstation.</p>
